Licensing For Commercial Use

Someone asked me about licensing PAWS for commercial usage. In other words
they wanted to know if they could use PAWS to create a game or other program
and then sell it, and what my licensing terms would be.

Basically my licensing terms are the same for any usage of PAWS/Universe,
commercial or not. They boil down to these points:

    Anyone can use PAWS for any purpose they deem fit, without paying me any
    royalties or other financial considerations. In other words, do what you
    like--using PAWS won't cost you a dime. HOWEVER, there are a few (minor)
    restrictions for commercial usage.

    You can't claim you wrote PAWS or the documentation that comes with them.
    For the privilege of using PAWS all I ask is that you credit me as the
    creator of PAWS and its documentation somewhere in your own documentation.
    A mention in your introduction would be sufficient.

    You must include a copy of the unmodified PAWS Developer Edition with your
    commercial product. A copy of the  ZIP file you downloaded is acceptable.
    If you want to modify PAWS for your game/program/product feel free.
    Likewise if you want to distribute only the compiled PYC versions of your
    modified copy of PAWS, go right ahead. However you must also include a
    complete unmodified copy of the Developer Edition as well.

    You may not sell PAWS by itself, nor charge a fee for media, although you
    are free to sell any software you develop yourself that runs under PAWS.
    In other words, you can't charge for a CD containing PAWS alone, but you
    can sell a CD containing PAWS and your own program(s). You may also place
    PAWS on a CD containing a compilation of different programs and charge for
    that. Again, it must be an unmodified copy of the PAWS Developer Edition,
    containing everything that came in the original ZIP file.

    Game authors who have no intention of selling their games (placing them in
    the IF-Fiction archive for example) do NOT have to include a copy of the
    PAWS Developer Edition with their game, that would be silly.

My intent is not to profit from PAWS nor even to prevent others from profiting
from it. I merely want to receive credit for having created PAWS and to keep
PAWS itself completely free to anyone who wants to use it--for whatever purpose
they want to use it for!

So if you want to develop and sell a commercial product with PAWS be my guest.
Use of PAWS for ANY purpose is royalty free and, except for the conditions
noted above, otherwise unrestricted.
